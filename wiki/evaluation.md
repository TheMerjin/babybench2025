# Evaluation

We propose a multi-criteria evaluation framework that considers the quality of generated behaviors, adherence to developmental principles, and the effectiveness of intrinsic motivation mechanisms. Each submission will be evaluated based on the following key dimensions:
Behavioral (40%)
Consistency with infant behavior
Diversity
Stability and refinement
Some Metrics:
Frequency of Self-Touch Events and Duration of Contact (DiMercurio et al., 2018)  
Tactile Stimulation Map
Developmental Progression of Self-Touch (Based on Rochat, 1998; DiMercurio et al., 2018)
Early stage: random, uncoordinated limb movements with occasional self-contact.
Intermediate stage: intentional reaching toward body parts with increased repetition.
Advanced stage: coordinated and deliberate self-exploration.
Developmental (30%)
Are behaviors results of developmental processes and sensorimotor feedback.
Is the approach backed by literature?
Intrinsic motivation (20%)
Exploratory behaviors:
Does the agent engage in spontaneous behavior in the absence of task-driven exploration?
Adaptive exploration: 
Is there a progressive complexity of the behavior?
Use of intrinsic rewards or self-supervised exploration.
Are there proof of the use of intrinsic rewards guiding the behavior.
Quality Implementation and Demonstration (10%)
Code quality, documentation.
Video demonstration and report clarity.
